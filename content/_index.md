# About Us

Our goal is to bring together the Vancouver community of VFX and animation pipeline developers to talk shop. The group's membership is open, and we encourage anyone who is interested to come by and join the discussion!

# The Forum

Once a month, we gather to discuss a handful of topics related to our craft. It's an opportunity to reflect on the past, talk about the present, and dream into the future. With a little organization and note taking, we try to capture the current thoughts and opinions of the community as a record for the future to look back on, and for those who are not able to be with us in person.
