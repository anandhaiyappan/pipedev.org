Hi All!

Thanks to those who responded to the survey that I sent out. If you just subscribed to the list you likely didn't get the email, but now you are getting this one!

For our first meeting, things will be pretty low key. I really want to hear your thoughts on the group and what you'd be interested in seeing going forward, whether it is organized talks, more coffee nights, organized debates, discussions or anything else! I will also bring with me a few topic ideas just to spark some conversations, and feel free to bring your own as well.

For those of you that can't make it on Tuesday, rest assured you'll get your chance again soon! If the venue works out for us or we find another suitable one I would like to try and introduce a regular schedule, something like once a month.

### Tuesday, April 16, 2019 | 6:30pm - 8:30pm
#### 900 Howe St #100, Vancouver, BC
Look for a **PIPEDEV** sign, I will do my best to get us a little space.
