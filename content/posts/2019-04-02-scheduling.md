Hello Everyone!

Just wanted to say thank you so much for your interest in a pipeline developer group. I think coming together as a community will be a great experience and I hope that you are as excited as I am.

I really want to gauge who all is interested and what you're hoping to get out of this venture. I'm thinking that we should all have a chance to meet face to face, informally at first, and get the ball rolling. Please continue to spread the word in your professional networks to anyone who might be interested, and share the link below.

Depending on the final headcount and availability, I'll find a place downtown for us to have a decent conversation. If you are interested in being there, please fill out the form below!
